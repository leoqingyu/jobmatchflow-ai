# Tailored materials manifest

Write this manifest only after both final PDF uploads succeed. It is a local handoff artifact, not a second App database.

```json

  "schema_version": 1,

```

Use absolute local paths. Each `filename` is the clean employer-facing basename, not an App storage/download name. The application Agent must still confirm both files exist before browser upload and follow the outbound-filename rules in `$jobmatchflow-apply`. If it has to download either material again, it recreates a local copy with the manifest filename before attaching it. The App's current job materials are authoritative for snapshot creation; local hashes only protect the handoff within the current computer.
